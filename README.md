# Cropheterosis-RNA
Dissecting the molecular mechanisms controlling crop heterosis using deep learning could accelerate crop improvement. My research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying crop heterosis, specifically in barley and maize, using long-read RNA sequencing. We utilize Oxford Nanopore Technologies for RNA sequencing.
