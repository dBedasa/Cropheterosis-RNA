# Cropheterosis-RNA
Dissecting the molecular mechanisms controlling crop heterosis using deep learning could accelerate crop improvement. My research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying crop heterosis through long-read RNA sequencing, with barley and maize as model crops. We utilize Oxford Nanopore Technologies for RNA sequencing. Artificial intelligence-based deep learning models are among the most promising tools for discovering gene regulatory networks related to the mechanisms controlling crop heterosis.
